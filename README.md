# leihs - a borrowing/lending/resource management system

## General

leihs is a web-based system to manage the circulation of items within an
organization or institution. In our case, we use it to keep track of who uses
our cameras, lighting equipment, speakers, microphones etc.

## Potential corruption of data in older leihs versions

There is a potential corruption of pricing data in leihs between versions
3.13.0 and 3.29.0. If you have been running one of those versions for any
length of time, please [read our advisory](http://blog.zhdk.ch/leihs/2015/06/30/potential-corruption-of-some-pricing-data-in-leihs-versions-between-3-13-0-and-3-29-0/).
